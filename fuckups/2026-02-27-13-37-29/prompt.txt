I'm working on a patch that will remove an old experiment from chromium and add a new experiment in its place. The old experiment was called "MediaPickerAdoption" and the new one should be called "MediaPickerRegression". I've only gotten partway through the CL, but I don't quite understand how to get chromium features plumbed through to android. The old experiment had multiple groups, but mine only should have an enabled/disabled group, and I think that changes how things should be done. You can find most of the changes here: /chromium/src/components/browser_ui/photo_picker/android/java/src/org/chromium/components/browser_ui/photo_picker/PhotoPickerFeatures.java. You should use 'git diff main' to show what the changes are that I've made so far.
